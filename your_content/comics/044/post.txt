<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

I for one would love to hear Ackerley's dramatic backstory for this little venture.

<h2>Transcript</h2>

ACKERLEY: So, any idea where this field is?
AVA: Nah, but I figured we'll find it if we keep walking.
ACKERLEY: Ahh, the beginning of a <i>truly</i> grand adventure.
AVA: So far it's pretty much like every other one we've done...
AVA: ...only without all your dramatic backstories.]
ACKERLEY: I'm sure I can come up with something.
AVA: Was it dumb that I brought Wanda along?
ACKERLEY: Does it make you happy?
AVA: Well, I guess, but...I can't get her to <b><i>do</b></i> anything.
AVA: I just feel completely <i>useless.</i>
ACKERLEY: Don't you even <i>start</i> with that.
ACKERLEY: You're a smart and capable hewan.
ACKERLEY: You don't need to cast magical spells to prove it.
AVA: Thanks, Ackerley.
