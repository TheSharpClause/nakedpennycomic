<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

There is perhaps no greater motivation to write Ackerley than to see his puffy angry feathery face. Magnificent.

Side note: <i>"Degrant"</i> (pronounced <i>dɛgrɪnt</i>) is a specific insult in Mothorial. It's closest literal definition would be something like "a person who I wouldn't deign to acknowledge if I didn't have to do so." You only use this term when you're being particularly dismissive of someone.
